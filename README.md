# BattleshipProject-BattleshipProject
The homework from Module 4, Battleship Project, of the Complete Foundation in C# Course Series from Tim Corey. We are to build a small, two-player console game that has its roots in the game Battleship from Mattel. There will be a 25-spot grid (A1 â€“ E5). Each player will place five pegs on the board to represent their five ships. Players will then take turns firing on their opponent's ships. The first person to sink all five ships wins.

For Lesson 2, WOULD Framework, we are to try going through the first two steps of the WOULD framework on the Battleship Lite Application.

For Lesson 3, W & O Steps, we are to try finishing up the planning phase (U, L, and D) on our own before we do it together in the next video.

For Lesson 4,U, L, & D Steps, we are to create a Class Library with our data models. After we have completed it, we can compare it to what we do in the next lesson.

For Lesson 5, Class Library Creation, we are to create a Console project in our solution and add in the methods the Console App will need.

For Lesson 6, Console App Creation Part 1, there were no additional tasks.

For Lesson 7, Console App Creation Part 2, we are to fill in the methods that have not been implemented. In the end, we should have a working application.

For Lesson 8, Wire Up the Logic, we are to thoroughly test the application for bugs. Try to break it in various ways and then identify ways to fix it if you find a way to break it.

For Lesson 9, Debugging and Testing, we are to pick one new feautre (a small one) and add it to the application. Make sure to plan the change and test it after it is complete.
