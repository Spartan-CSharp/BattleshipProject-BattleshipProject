# BattleshipProject-BattleshipProject
The homework from Module 4, Battleship Project, of the Complete Foundation in C# Course Series from Tim Corey. We are to build a small, two-player console game that has its roots in the game Battleship from Mattel. There will be a 25-spot grid (A1 â€“ E5). Each player will place five pegs on the board to represent their five ships. Players will then take turns firing on their opponent's ships. The first person to sink all five ships wins.

For Lesson 2, WOULD Framework, we are to try going through the first two steps of the WOULD framework on the Battleship Lite Application.

For Lesson 3, W & O Steps, we are to try finishing up the planning phase (U, L, and D) on our own before we do it together in the next video.

For Lesson 4,U, L, & D Steps, we are to create a Class Library with our data models. After we have completed it, we can compare it to what we do in the next lesson.
